### Current Development Status

- Initialized the backend service using **FastAPI**.
- Created basic project folder structure under `/backend`.
- Added first API route: `GET /expenses` (using in-memory data).
- Configured and tested FastAPI with Uvicorn locally.
- Set up `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
- Feature branch workflow initiated (`feature/backend-initial-setup`).

### Next Steps (Upcoming Work)
- Add additional API endpoints (`POST /expenses`, `/summary`, `/health`).
- Set up database folder and starter configuration (PostgreSQL).
- Start database connection logic.
- Later integrate Docker setup for backend.

> Development is currently in a feature branch and will continue before creating a PR.
